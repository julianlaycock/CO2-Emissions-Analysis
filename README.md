# CO₂ Emissions Analysis

I created a CO₂ per capita analysis for five major economies using Python and pandas. The project analyzes per capita CO₂ emissions for five major economies:
Australia, China, Germany, India, and the United States.

## What this project shows

- Data loading and cleaning with pandas
- Transformation: filtering, sorting, and computing year-over-year percentage changes
- Descriptive statistics and volatility analysis by country
- Visualizations of CO₂ emissions and growth patterns over time
- Clear, consulting-style insights and recommendations

## Files

- `1_CO2 Emissions Analysis_Report.ipynb` — report notebook
- `2_CO2 Emissions Analysis_Code.ipynb` - code notebook
- `co2_emissions.csv` — source dataset used in the notebook

## How to use

1. Open `1_CO2 Emissions Analysis_Report.ipynb` directly in GitHub to read the report.
2. Download `1_CO2 Emissions Analysis_Report.ipynb` and `2_CO2 Emissions Analysis_Code.ipynb` if you want to run the code locally in Jupyter.
